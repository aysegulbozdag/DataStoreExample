## Data Store

Jetpack Data Store is a data storage solution for keeping data in key-value form.

Data store uses coroutines and flow to store data asynchronously and consistently. Data store is ideal for simple datasets.

There are 2 types;

- Proto Data Store
- Preferences Data store -> there is an example of this in this repo.
